Well damn, Plucky is coding? The lore expands...
I like to craft stories, in my head, on a guitar, thinking up game ideas (which is one of the reasons I'm starting to learn how to code). Currently learning CSS and HTML, moving to JavaScript soon; Side projects on Aseperite and Godot along the way. Reach out to me on Reddit if you really want to, username is pluckyknight3.
Pronouns: He/Him

Plucky comes from the Gamertag PluckyKnight3 (thanks Microsoft :) <- yes I used the end of it to make a smiley face on purpose -> PluckyKnight has seen many changes over time. At first, I hated it and couldn't wait to change it. I didn't have an Xbox, and I was too young to be smart enough to change it online. But when I eventually got the darned Xbox (360, 4 GB Slim, no Kinect tho), I got too attached to the name and it stuck.
